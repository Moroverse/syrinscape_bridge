# syrinscape_bridge

Syrinscape Bridge allows Syrinscape Sound Links and Fantasy Grounds Syrinscape Sound Chat Triggers to work correctly on macOS with Fantasy Grounds Unity (FGU) and the Syrinscape Online (beta) Player.

<b>Problem:</b> Syrinscape Online Player does not correctly handle Syrinscape Online URI's so sounds are never requested to play.

<b>Solution:</b> Syrinscape Bridge registers for Syrinscape Online Player URI's, intercepts them, and sends the requests to Syrinscape Online's REST API.
